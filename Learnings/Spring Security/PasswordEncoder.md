1. `@Bean`: Marks the method as a Spring-managed bean, meaning Spring will create and manage the `PasswordEncoder` instance.
2. `PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder()`: Method name (can be anything, but `passwordEncoder` is a convention).
3. `return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();`: Returns an instance of `BCryptPasswordEncoder`, which is used to **hash passwords securely**.

### **Why use `BCryptPasswordEncoder`?**
- **One-way hashing**: Encrypts passwords, making them non-reversible.
- **Salted hashing**: Adds random data to prevent rainbow table attacks.
- **Adaptive hashing**: Can increase computational cost as hardware improves, making brute-force attacks harder.

### **Usage in Spring Security**
You use this encoder to hash passwords before saving them to the database:
```java
String hashedPassword = passwordEncoder().encode("mySecretPassword");
```
And verify it during login:
```java
boolean matches = passwordEncoder().matches("mySecretPassword", storedHashedPassword);
```
